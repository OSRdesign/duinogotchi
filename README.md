## Before you start:
Duinogotchi is a companion app to work with an already working Duino-Coin mining setup based on raspberry pi with either Arduino or RP2040 connected by USB.
so far tested and wroking on Rpi4B, Rpi5 and Rpi zero 2W but **not working on Rpi Zero W**
it's completely inspired from the screen rendering of Pwnagotchi and the "faces" are from the 
to get there you'll need:

-an account and verified to mine the fantastic Duino-Coin :https://duinocoin.com/

-a waveshare eink 2.13inch display HAT V3 or V4 : https://www.waveshare.com/product/2.13inch-e-paper-hat.htm

you will need to follow the setup of the eink screen as described in the wiki:
